2)Time this function for various n e.g. n = 1,2,3.... You should have small values of n all the way up to large values. Plot "time" vs "n" (time on y-axis and n on x-axis). Also, fit a curve to your data, hint it's a polynomial.

4)Around n = 1800, the blue line starts showing more fluctuations and diverges from the red polynomial fit. Indicating that the time line does not align with the predicted polynomial curve.
n_0  is typically the point where the behavior of the measured data (blue line) starts to deviate significantly from the expected trend (red curve). That's why I selected n_0 approx 1800.
